### Description

This chatbot can have small, simple converstations with you. It will look for keywords within the user's input and respond accordingly. If it doesn't find a keyword that matches the user's input it will respond with a generic response. The user can also ask the same thing over and over and the bot will respond in one of three different ways. Additionally, if you tell the bot your name, the bot will remember your name and respond with it later on! <br>

An additional feature that the bot offers is games! The first game that you can ask the bot to play is "flip a coin". Once the user asks this, the bot will respond with either heads or tails. Second, the bot can play rock, paper, scissors! The user needs to either say "rock", "paper" or "scissors" and the bot will respond with their choice (of rock, paper or scissors) and the winner of the round. After playing a few rounds the user can also ask the bot for the "score" and the bot will let the user know the score and who is winning.
